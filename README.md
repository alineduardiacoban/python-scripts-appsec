The ”bruteforce.py” and ”dirbust.py” scripts are used for bruteforcing passwords and directories. 
The ”reset-password” scripts are used to abuse ”forgot-password” vulnerabilities:
- ”reset-password.py”: reads emails from a .txt file
- ”reset-password-csv.py”: reads emails from a .csv file  

Feel free to adapt it to your needs. It can be used with Burp or any other proxy and **must** only be used in controlled environments, for learning purposes or with prior consent from a specific organization. 
I do not take responsibility for the misuse of the scripts.
